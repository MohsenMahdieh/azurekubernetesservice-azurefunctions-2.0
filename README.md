Azure Kubernetes Service: Azure Function triggered by Azure Blog storage and Event Hub sample

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. You can read about Azure Functions 2.0 general availability @ Introducing Azure Functions 2.0.  Runtime 2.0 runs on .NET Core 2, which means it can run on all platforms supported by .NET Core, including macOS and Linux. This enables cross-platform development and hosting scenarios. In this article I am going to

Create Azure Functions triggered by Azure Blob storage and Event hub in Visual Studio Code
Debug locally in Visual Studio Code
Deploy Azure Functions to Azure Kubernetes Service
Dev tools used to develop these components are Visual Studio Code for macOS, Docker, AKS Dashboard and kubectl.
